**This is just an initial idea**

Given that the Juno community in this charter era needs to fund projects in a more serious and responsible manner, we need clear guidelines on how specific proposals must be submitted.

This is just an initial idea/effort to create a sample that potential builders **must** use to present their projects adequately and give the community a clear idea of their skills, solution, product, and business plan.

Review [this](https://github.com/tonyler/Juno-Grants/blob/main/proposal_sample.md) and ensure to provide feedback for any relevant changes. 

_Credit goes to the Secret Network community. This is heavily inspired by their own grant proposal guidelines._
